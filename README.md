This repository contains the code and data for a Master's thesis project conducted at **ISEL - Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa**, focusing on predicting the driving range of electric vehicles (EVs) using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to address the variability in existing heuristic techniques for driving range estimation, providing more accurate and reliable predictions for EV users.

## Project Abstract

In recent years, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained widespread acceptance due to their reliability and eco-friendly nature. For consumers, a crucial factor in choosing an EV is its driving range (DR) capability. However, existing heuristic techniques often provide inconsistent DR values, leading to driver anxiety. This thesis explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate the DR of EVs. Using publicly available data, a comprehensive dataset comprising information from over 9 different EV models and 3252 trips was created. Regression techniques were applied to these datasets, resulting in accurate DR estimations for both short and long trips. This approach eliminates the need for unreliable heuristic techniques, alleviating driver anxiety and enabling better trip planning.

## Thesis Objectives

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Gathered data from diverse EV models and trips.
   - Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset for analysis.

2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implemented regression techniques for DR estimation.
   - Evaluated models using standard metrics for accuracy and reliability.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compared different eRange prediction approaches.
   - Investigated the impact of various datasets and training configurations on ML models.

4. **Future Work:**
   - Planned integration with real-time EV information for continuous eRange estimations.
   - Intended inclusion of additional features like driving patterns and road elevation for enhanced predictions.
