    abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) are promoted as a viable near-term vehicle technology to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional vehicles (CVs). In spite of the benefits of EVs, several obstacles need to be overcome before EVs will be widely adopted. A major barrier is that consumers tend to resist new technologies that are considered alien or unproved, thus, policy decisions that consider their critical concerns will have a higher level of success. This research identifies potential socio-technical barriers to consumer adoption of EVs and determines if sustainability issues influence consumer decision to purchase an EV. This study provides valuable insights into preferences and perceptions of technology enthusiasts; individuals highly connected to technology development and better equipped to sort out the many differences between EVs and CVs. This group of individuals will likely be early adopters of EVs only if they perceive them to be superior in performance compared to CVs. These results can guide policymakers in crafting energy and transportation policy. It can also provide guidance to EV engineers' decision in incorporating consumer preference into EV engineering design.}

    abstract = { AbstractThis manuscript focuses on the modeling of electric vehicle (EV) driver’s range anxiety, a fear that a vehicle does not have sufficient range, or state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack, to reach its destination and would strand its occupants. Despite numerous research studies on the modeling of charging behaviors, modeling efforts to understand at what battery percentages do EV drivers charge their vehicles, and what are the associated contributing factors, are rather limited. To this end, an ensemble learning model based on gradient boosting is developed. The model sequentially fits new predictors to new residuals of the previous prediction and, then, minimizes the loss when adding the latest prediction. A total of 18 features are defined and extracted from the multisource data, which cover information on driver, vehicles, stations, traffic conditions, as well as spatial-temporal context information of the charging events. The analyzed dataset includes 4.5-year’s charging event log data from 3,096 users and 468 public charging stations in Kansas City Missouri, and the macroscopic travel demand model maintained by the metropolitan planning organization. The result shows the proposed model achieved a satisfactory result with a R square value of 0.54 and root mean square error of 0.14, both better than multiple linear regression model and random forest model. To reduce range anxiety, it is suggested that the priorities of deploying new charging facilities should be given to the areas with higher daily traffic prediction, with more conservative EV users or that are further from residential areas. }

    abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is continuously unleashing its power in a wide range of applications. It has been pushed to the forefront in recent years partly owing to the advent of big data. ML algorithms have never been better promised while challenged by big data. Big data enables ML algorithms to uncover more fine-grained patterns and make more timely and accurate predictions than ever before; on the other hand, it presents major challenges to ML such as model scalability and distributed computing. In this paper, we introduce a framework of ML on big data (MLBiD) to guide the discussion of its opportunities and challenges. The framework is centered on ML which follows the phases of preprocessing, learning, and evaluation. In addition, the framework is also comprised of four other components, namely big data, user, domain, and system. The phases of ML and the components of MLBiD provide directions for identification of associated opportunities and challenges and open up future work in many unexplored or under explored research areas.}

Data mining is a fast growing application area in business. Machine learning techniques are used for data analysis and pattern discovery and thus can play a key role in the development of data mining applications. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in the context of business is useful in selecting an appropriate method for a specific application. The paper, therefore, provides an overview of machine learning techniques and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in the context of mining business data. A survey of data mining applications in business is provided to investigate the use of learning techniques. Rule induction (RI) was found to be most popular, followed by neural networks (NNs) and case-based reasoning (CBR). Most applications were found in financial areas, where prediction of the future was a dominant task category.}

@COMMENT{abstract = {In this technical report the range estimation problem is addressed. It aims to introduce to the students some basic concepts on electric range (eRange) prediction, such as instantaneous power consumption, battery state of charge, for example, while introducing a basic method to be used as a reference (baseline). In addition, a new history-based algorithm using an adaptive model is proposed for electric driving range (eRange) estimation and some results are present when using the BMW i3 94Ah model as an application example. The results obtained show that the adaptive history-based method produce much more accurate and reliable estimates than the basic method.}}
