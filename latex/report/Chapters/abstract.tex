%\todo[inline]{Inportancia dos EV}

The electric vehicle (EV) use as a reliable
and eco-friendly means of transportation has increased
rapidly over the past few years.
%\todo[inline]{Correlação entre uso de EVs e a performance}
When choosing an EV, the vehicle's driving range capacity is a 
decisive factor to be taken into account as it
 minimizes drive's anxiety while driving.
%\todo[inline]{Problema da previsão da autonomia}
An EV's driving range prediction depends on multiple
factors that must be factored in to accurately infer results.
%\todo[inline]{Uso de inteligência artificial}
As machine learning has become a widely used approach
for highly complex problems such as the EV driving range
prediction, machine learning based solutions already
provide accurate enough solutions for the problem.
%\todo[inline]{Solução já existente}
%Previous work has covered a history-based method on an 
%adaptive model for EV's driving range prediction.
The present project explores the implementation of
a machine learning based model to learn and adapt
from existing data, while aiming to provide more
real and accurate results.

%The dissertation must contain two versions of the abstract, one in the same language as the main text, another in a different language. The package assumes the two languages under consideration are always Portuguese and English.
%
%The package will sort the abstracts in the proper order. This means the first abstract will be in the same language as the main text, followed by the abstract in the other language, and then followed by the main text.
%
%The abstract is critical because many researchers will read only that part. Your abstract should provide an accurate and sufficiently detailed summary of your work so that readers will understand what you did, why you did it, what your findings are, and why your findings are useful and important.
%
%The abstract should not contain bibliography citations, tables, charts or diagrams. Abbreviations should be limited. Abbreviations that are defined in the abstract will need to be defined again at first use in the main text.
%
%Finally, you must avoid the use of expressions such as "The present work deals with ... ", "In this thesis are discussed .... ", "The document concludes that .... ", "apparently and .... " etc.
%
%The word limit should be observed, 300 words is the limit.
%
%Abstracts are usually followed by a list of keywords selected by the author. Choosing appropriate keywords is important, because these are used for indexing purposes. Well-chosen keywords enable your manuscript to be more easily identified and cited.
