\section{Intro}

The initial stage of this project was
completed with another 4 curricular units,
focusing on finding usable datasets for 
a replication of \gls{eRange} estimation
through "basic" \gls{SOC} based estimation, 
and adaptive history based model approaches.
Additional research on of existing related works,
has also been executed for better understanding
of the problem regarding \gls{eRange} estimation
and its difficulties.
