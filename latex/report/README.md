# thesisisel

The thesisisel is designed to create a bachelor or master degrees report written in LaTex

1. Instructions

This template serves both degrees as a bachelor's and master's degree. And, during the development stages of the work as
final or "Preparation of BSc (MSc) dissertation". To do this simply change the following settings (see template.tex,
line 34-46):

	\documentclass[
		msc,		% (*) msc, prepmsc, bsc, prepbsc - degree
					% prepbsc(msc) Preparation of BSc (MSc) dissertation
					% bsc(msc) BSc graduation report/ MSc dissertation
		pt,			% (*) pt, en - languages 
		twoside,	% (*) twoside, oneside - single or double sided printing
		12pt,		% (*) 12pt, 11pt, 10pt - use font size
		a4paper,	% Paper size/format
		utf8,			% (*) utf8, latin1	- Text encoding: Linux, Mac or Windows
		onpaper, % (*) onpaper, onscreen Format your thesis in a way that presents well on paper and/or on screen
		hyperref = true,  % (*) true, false - Hyperlinks in citations
		listof=totoc
		]{thesisisel}

2. Description

thesisisel This is the main directory and includes:

	2.1 Appendixes: Directory with tex files with a section or table of subsidiary matter at the end of a book or document;
	2.2 Logo: Directory with Faculty logos;
	2.3 Chapters: Directory where to put user files (text and figures);
		
		2.3.1 scripts: Directory with useful bash scripts, e.g., for cleaning all temporary files;
		2.3.2 img: Directory with all images to use in the chapters, e.g. \texttt{ra-raster.png};
	
	2.4 alpha-pt.bst: A file with bibliography names in portuguese, e.g., 'Relatório Técnico' e 'Tese de Mestrado' instead of 'Technical Report' and 'Master Thesis'. This file is used automatically if Portuguese is selected as the main language (see below);
	2.5 defaults.tex: A file with the main default values for the package (institution name, faculty's logo, degree name and similars - TO CHANGE BY THE USER);
	2.6 personaldataofthesis.tex: A file with the main default values for the package (identification of report as well as the author and juries - TO CHANGE BY THE USER);
	2.7 template.tex: The main file. You should run  \texttt{LaTeX} in this one. Please refrain from changing the file content outside of the well defined area;
	2.8 bibliography.bib: The bib file. An easy way to find to import citation into bibtex is select option "Show links to import citation into BibTex" in \href{http://scholar.google.pt/scholar_settings?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5}{Scholar google settings}.
	2.9 thesisisel.cls: The  LaTeX class file for the thesis{} style. Currently, some of the defaults are stored here instead of \verb!defaults.tex!. This file should not be changed, unless you're ready to play with fire! :) - DO NOT CHANGE);

All of these files should be in the same folder. The outputs will be a .pdf file called **template.pdf** with the
manuscript. After that, this should be renamed.

In addition, latex generates extra files which are .aux, .log, .out, .bbl and .synctex.gz. Theses files provide
important info:

	.log - about the compiler that you are running (warning and errors);
	.aux, .sync, .toc and others - are needed for things to actually work when you compile your document multiple times.

Deleting them can break things, then it's not really a great idea to (automatically) remove them. However, if you desire
to have a cleaner working directory, there are a few ways to accomplish that. For example, you can compile your document
with the output-directory
parameter. [Read more ...](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/369771/how-to-delete-files-generated-by-latex)

3. Some informations

The template will first automatically place the abstract in the language of the main text and then the abstract in the
other language. For example, if the dissertation is written in Portuguese, the abstract will appear first in Portuguese,
then in English, followed by the main text in Portuguese.
